#CS214 Projects#
Projects are all coded in pure C.  I was not yet saving my code to Bitbucket, so there is no real commit history here.  For examples of what my commit history normally looks like, please see CS416 repository.

##Asst0##
String Parsing.

##Asst1##
Recreating malloc.
*This project is not a good example.  Please see my CS416 repository, virtual memory (Asst2).  I had to recreate malloc from scratch for that project because this version was faulty.

##Asst2##
Recursively list elements of file system.

##Asst3##
Distributed File System
